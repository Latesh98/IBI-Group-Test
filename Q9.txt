Output:
array 1: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s
array 2: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s

Explaination:
1  var arr1 = "john".split('');: This line creates an array arr1 with the individual characters of the string "john", so arr1 becomes ['j', 'o', 'h', 'n'].

2  var arr2 = arr1.reverse();: This line reverses the array arr1 in place and assigns it to arr2. The reverse() method modifies the original array and also returns a reference to the modified array. So both arr1 and arr2 will refer to the same reversed array, which is ['n', 'h', 'o', 'j'].

3  var arr3 = "jones".split('');: This line creates a new array arr3 with the individual characters of the string "jones", so arr3 becomes ['j', 'o', 'n', 'e', 's'].

4  arr2.push(arr3);: This line pushes the entire array arr3 as a single element to the end of arr2. Now, arr2 becomes ['n', 'h', 'o', 'j', ['j', 'o', 'n', 'e', 's']].

5  console.log("array 1: length=" + arr1.length + " last=" + arr1.slice(-1));: This line logs the length of arr1, which is 5, and the last element of arr1 using arr1.slice(-1). The slice(-1) method returns the last element of the array. As arr1 was reversed earlier, the last element will be 's'.

6  console.log("array 2: length=" + arr2.length + " last=" + arr2.slice(-1));: This line logs the length of arr2, which is 5, and the last element of arr2 using arr2.slice(-1). The last element of arr2 is an array ['j', 'o', 'n', 'e', 's'], so it will be displayed as it is.
